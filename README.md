## Writing and submitting specifications documents
Any contributor to DeviceFuture's projects can submit specifications documents for review. To do so, you will need to fork this repo and then make a copy of [0000-TEMPLATE.md](0000-TEMPLATE.md). You should name this copy `0000-SUBMISSION.md` so that we can then assign it an ID. Edit `0000-SUBMISSION.md` so that it contains your specifications.

Read the comment at the top of the submission template and delete it after you have completed your submission. Once done, submit a pull request for review and we'll check it and accept/reject your spec accordingly. We may also ask for further changes if we think there's more to add to your spec.
