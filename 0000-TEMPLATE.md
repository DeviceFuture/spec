Please delete this block comment before submitting your issue.

Ensure that you replace fields with square brackets (such as `[Spec Name]`) with relevant information. You do not need to specify a specification ID since it is determined when it is accepted.

Numbers in square brackets which are proceeded with a `G` (such as `[G1]`) refer to further guidance which is shown below.

* [G1]: May not be applicable. Please write `N/A` if this is the case.
* [G2]: An area can either be `Meta` for discussion about the specifications in general, `Community` for information about community management/events, or `Other` if this spec does not fit into any specific area.
* [G3]: Please link to issues as full URLs. For GitHub issue #123, write:
  ```
  [GH#123](https://github.com/issues/123)
  ```
* [G4]: A reviewer will set this field for you. You can leave it as-is for now.

Dates must be written in the form YYYY-MM-DD, where YYYY is the 4-digit year, MM is the 2-digit month, and DD is the 2-digit day of the month. When the month or day of the month is only 1 digit, then it must be preceeded with a `0`.

The delimiter for multiple items within spec property values is a semicolon followed by a space (`; `).
